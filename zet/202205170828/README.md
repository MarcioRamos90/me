- scaning

Today I have disvered how to make scans in an website usisng a script in pyhton called
'`dirb` usinf the pattern ```dirb <ip> <path/to/list_of_words>``` I be able to make the
scan of possible endpoints, the lib has a common list of word /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt.
Better to keep 	calm because it scan through 4612 words
